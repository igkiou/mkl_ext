-Do rank-one SVD/EIG updates using either LAPACK secular euqation solver, or GLR algorithm, or Cheb-based root finding.
-QR updates, see papers I printed before SIGGRAPH.
-Change low-order chol up/down-dates to improved algorithms over LINPACK.
-random SVD (either my own simple, or redSVD, or port Tygert's implementation).
-PROPACK port (either exact port of MATLAB code, or port of Matt O'Toole's simplified version).
-Look into row/column modifications for Chol.
-Maybe nystrom for SVD.
-Change rank-r update code for cholesky to more efficient version by Davis et al.
-Maybe look into Monte-Carlo algorithms?
-Find way to do rank estimate.
-Maybe rename into numerical_utils, and expand in scope.
-Add filtering/convolution wrappers.
-Add boost to RNG? Problem is boost is C++ and this is meant to be strictly C only.
